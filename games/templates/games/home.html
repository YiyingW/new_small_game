          <h2>Connect 4 Game</h2>
          <p>This game is centuries old, Captain James Cook used to play it with his fellow officers on his long voyages, and so it has also been called "Captain's Mistress". Milton Bradley (now owned by Hasbro) published a version of this game called "Connect Four" in 1974.</p>

          <h2>Where You Are</h2>
          <p>Perhaps to lose a sense of where you are implies the danger of losing a sense of who you are. I thought—to lose your direction is to lose your face. So here he comes to ask his direction from the lost, the invisible. Very well, I’ve learned to live without direction.</p>
